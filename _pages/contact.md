  Get in touch with Lee Whittaker for Rails architecture, performance optimization, and fractional CTO consulting.
---

Whether your Rails system is slowing down, becoming difficult to change, or approaching an important growth stage,
I help teams stabilize their foundations and deliver with confidence.  
If you need architectural clarity, system rescue, or technical leadership, I’m here to support you.

---

## What I Can Help With

### **Rails Architecture & System Stabilization**
- Infrastructure modernization (Docker, CI/CD, observability)
- Memory reduction, performance tuning, and bottleneck elimination
- Concurrency fixes, transactional integrity, and race-condition resolution
- Scalable background job pipelines and async architecture
- Database optimization and query performance

### **Fractional CTO Support**
- Architecture audits using 4+1 system modeling
- Technical strategy for 0–1 and 1–N product stages
- Codebase modernization and domain alignment
- Developer workflow improvements and DX optimization
- Documentation, onboarding, and internal knowledge systems

### **Legacy & High-Stakes Systems**
- Rescue of fragile or outdated Rails applications
- Removing scaling, encoding, and deployment failures
- Stabilizing codebases with inconsistent tests or unpredictable behavior
- Preparing for audits, investor scrutiny, or rapid growth

## Ideal Project Types

### **Perfect Fit**
- Complex Rails problems requiring deep architectural insight  
- Systems with reliability concerns or unknown failure modes  
- Projects where correctness, stability, and performance matter  
- Companies needing senior leadership without hiring a full-time CTO  
- Systems approaching scale, regulatory pressure, or mission-critical use  

### **Let’s Discuss**
- Large greenfield products needing long-term architectural guidance  
- High-urgency deadlines where stability must be restored quickly  
- Multi-team technical alignment or platform refactoring  

### **Not a Fit**
- Simple websites or brochure-style projects  
- No-architecture “just code this fast” environments  
- WordPress, Wix, or non-Rails CMS work
