description: "Lee Whittaker - Unity game developer and Rails consultant helping indie developers and growing businesses solve complex technical challenges."
---

I'm a software engineer who bridges the gap between **game development** and **enterprise software solutions**. With expertise spanning Unity development and Ruby on Rails consulting, I help indie developers build better games while solving complex technical challenges for growing businesses.

## What I Bring to Your Project

**Game Development Expertise**
- **Unity Asset Store Publisher**: Creating tools and plugins that thousands of developers rely on
- **Procedural Generation**: Building maze generators, 3D assets, and algorithmic content systems
- **Performance Optimization**: Helping teams achieve smooth framerates and efficient resource usage
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Turning game concepts into playable experiences quickly

**Enterprise Development & Consulting**
- **Legacy System Rescue**: Upgrading critical Rails applications from end-of-life Ruby 3.0.7 to modern, supported versions
- **International Scaling**: Solving UTF-8 encoding challenges that block global market expansion
- **Database Concurrency**: Debugging race conditions and implementing proper locking mechanisms for high-stakes systems
- **Strategic Code Modification**: Enhancing existing systems without breaking functionality

## Recent Impact

- **Rescued a community choir management system** from 118 failing tests and security vulnerabilities, achieving 99.15% test success while upgrading to modern Rails
- **Eliminated international encoding errors** that were preventing e-commerce platforms from accepting global customers
- **Exposed critical race conditions** in legal hearing scheduling systems where passing tests were hiding dangerous concurrency failures
- **Streamlined prescription product workflows** for e-commerce brands expanding into regulated markets

## Technical Approach

I believe in **systematic problem-solving over quick fixes**. Whether debugging encoding errors that crash international deployments or building Unity tools that handle edge cases gracefully, I focus on solutions that work reliably across different environments and scale with your business needs.

My writing here reflects this approachâ€”real case studies from actual client work, showing both the technical solutions and the business impact they delivered.

## The WhittakerTech Vision

I'm building WhittakerTech as a **hybrid technology company** that serves both the gaming community and enterprise clients. This dual focus lets me bring gaming industry innovation to business problems while applying enterprise-grade reliability to game development challenges.

**Current Projects:**
- Unity Asset Store plugins and tools
- Rails consulting for scaling businesses
- Game development tutorials and educational content
- Open-source contributions to the developer community

## Let's Work Together

**For Game Developers:**
- Need Unity plugins or custom tools?
- Stuck on performance optimization or complex game mechanics?
- Want to learn procedural generation or advanced Unity techniques?

**For Growing Businesses:**
- Rails application showing its age?
- International expansion blocked by technical issues?
- Complex integrations that need custom solutions?
