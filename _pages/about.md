  Lee Whittaker — Fractional CTO, Rails architect, and performance engineer building scalable systems and
  accelerating delivery for teams that need clarity, stability, and measurable results.
---

I'm a systems-focused engineer and Fractional CTO specializing in **Rails architecture, DevOps reliability, and
performance optimization**. I help teams stabilize critical systems, accelerate delivery, and build technical
foundations that can grow confidently.

While my background includes Unity development, my work today centers on **architecting large Rails applications,
resolving complex infrastructure issues, and transforming fragile pipelines into predictable, scalable systems**.

## What I Bring to Your Organization

### **Senior Rails Architecture & System Design**

- **Complex System Rescue** — resolving failures rooted in architecture, not symptoms  
- **Concurrency & Data Integrity** — eliminating race conditions with proper locks, transactions, and workflows  
- **Performance Optimization** — increasing throughput, reducing memory use, and removing chokepoints  
- **Scalable Job Pipelines** — designing asynchronous systems that digest thousands of tasks reliably  
- **DevOps Maturity** — Docker, CI/CD, observability, and deployment stability with measurable improvements  

### **Technical Leadership & Delivery Acceleration**

- **Sprint Compression** — helping teams deliver 10-day workloads in 4 days through architecture clarity  
- **Developer Experience (DX)** — building internal tools and patterns that remove friction and guide best practices  
- **Documentation & Clarity** — 4+1 architecture, system maps, and durable reference materials  
- **Mentorship & Reform** — uplifting teams by removing systemic chaos, not blaming individuals

## Recent Impact

- **Increased image-processing throughput by 1100%**, enabling 1,361 images processed in 2 minutes  
- **Reduced memory consumption by 60%** by moving from Buildpacks to a modern Docker architecture  
- **Resolved silent concurrency corruption** inside a legal hearing scheduling system where tests were passing but data was failing  
- **Stabilized a legacy choir-management system**, rescuing 118 failing tests, modernizing Ruby & Rails, and restoring long-term maintainability  
- **Fixed UTF-8 internationalization failures** that blocked global customer onboarding  
- **Designed async pipelines and CI/CD flows** that eliminated deployment instability

## How I Work

I approach engineering the same way I approach architecture:  
**identify constraints, model the system, resolve the root cause, and ensure it's durable.**

Whether it’s:
- rewriting an unsafe job pipeline,  
- hardening Docker-based deployments,  
- untangling a high-risk code path, or  
- mapping an entire feature into 4+1 architecture views…

I focus on solutions that scale, survive new requirements, and reduce long-term cost.

My writing on this site reflects that philosophy:  
**real failures, real constraints, real fixes, and real metrics.**

## The WhittakerTech Vision

WhittakerTech is my ecosystem of tools, engines, and products built on a simple idea:

**Great engineering comes from clarity, modularity, and repeatable systems.**

Current initiatives include:
- **Ensemblize** — scheduling, communication, and organizational tools  
- **Subscribify** — SSOT subscription management across internal and external services  
- **Red Lily Music** — a DSL and UI for composing and exporting music via LilyPond  
- **Nicodemus** — auto-documentation through reflection, metadata, and knowledge graph extraction  
- **Spectra Galaxy** — design-system engine, tokens, and UI primitives for all WhittakerTech apps  

Each project advances the ecosystem — modular Rails engines that can be reused, extended, and combined.

## Who I Help

### **For Companies & Teams**
- Legacy Rails systems needing modernization  
- Systems suffering from concurrency failures or scaling bottlenecks  
- Organizations requiring a Fractional CTO to guide architecture and delivery  
- Teams needing DevOps clarity and CI/CD reliability  
- Products preparing for growth, audits, or investor scrutiny  

### **For Indie Builders & Founders**
- 0–1 product acceleration  
- Technical leadership without a full-time CTO  
- Architecture guidance for long-term sustainability  
- Clarity on data models, pipelines, and cost-efficient infrastructure  

If your technical challenges feel tangled, risky, or expensive…  
I bring the calm and clarity to straighten them out.
